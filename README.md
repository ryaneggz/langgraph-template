alembic upgrade head
```

```bash
python -m seeds.user_seeder
```

2. Create new

```bash
alembic revision -m "description_of_changes"
```

``bash
### Appliy Next
alembic upgrade +1

### Speicif revision
alembic upgrade <revis_id>

### Appliy Down
alembic downgrade -1

### Appliy Down
alembic downgrade <revis_id>

### History
